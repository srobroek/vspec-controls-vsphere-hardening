# vspec
vSpec is a set of inspec profiles specifically aimed at vsphere and VMware related products

# how to run
- Install inspec (https://inspec.io)

????

- Profit!

- I'll update this once the code has stabilised a bit. 

# Notes

The only OS this has been tested and found working on is Linux and the Linux subsystem for windows. It probably also works on OSX. Windows native is out because inspec doesn't support http on windows. If you want to run this on windows, install it as if you were installing it on linux using the linux subsystem. 

# Warning
